This discovery laid the foundation for the Big Bang theory, which suggests that the cosmos began around 13.8 billion years ago.\n"

        "Summary",
        "- Science serves as a pivotal tool for humans to observe, comprehend, and explain the natural world. Centuries of scientific inquiry and experimentation have yielded countless discoveries that shape modern life, revealing nature\u2019s beauty and complexity through fascinating facts. This work highlights key scientific insights: the universe is continuously expanding (a 1929 discovery by Edwin Hubble that underpins the Big Bang theory, dating the cosmos to 13.8 billion years ago); DNA, the universal genetic blueprint of life, shows unexpected connections (e.g., humans share 60% of their DNA with bananas); the human brain\u2014with 86 billion neurons and trillions of synaptic connections\u2014uses 20% of the body\u2019s energy despite accounting for only 2% of its mass; water\u2019s unique properties (expanding when freezing, acting as a universal solvent) enable life on Earth; light travels at 299,792 km/s in a vacuum, the fastest speed in the universe, with sunlight reaching Earth in over 8 minutes; Earth\u2019s atmosphere, particularly the ozone layer, shields life from harmful radiation and space debris; and Darwin\u2019s theory of evolution by natural selection explains the diversity of life (e.g., whales evolved from land mammals 50 million years ago). In conclusion, these scientific facts underscore the universe\u2019s vastness, the interconnectedness of life, and the ongoing growth of human knowledge, deepening our appreciation for the natural world and inspiring curiosity and innovation."
